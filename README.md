This document aims to be the distillation of my limited android knowledge intended for people who want to delve into the world of custom ROM development. Android development, at first, always seemed, to me, a really daunting task (and I must admit it sometimes is). However, in reality, it is very easy when the basic architecture of Android is understood.

## Why did you write this?

Even though Android is such a widely used platform, there is little to no documentation in regards to building it, even in websites like XDA. Even when it does exist, information is scattered and almost impossible to locate, unless you know where to find it. When I started, I too faced this issue. When your device tree does not boot and you don't know why, it can really dry up your motivation. That is why I wrote this document, to gather up everything I know about Android in one place and demystify custom ROM development.

## How do I read it?

The tutorial is split into chapters, each of which has a certain number of Markdown documents that deal with a specific topic.
